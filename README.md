# NetDot for Android
An game of Dots and Boxes for Android, implementing my [NetDot](https://gitlab.com/Magicrafter13/NetDot) protocol.

Originally designed with having 1:1 feature parity with my [Java version](https://gitlab.com/Magicrafter13/NetDot-Java) in mind. Now it has essentially become its successor, and is also giving me cause to improve the protocol further, and possibly even the master server browser!

Currently supports all the way back to Android 5 (Lollipop) - though this is subject to change if I get sick of seeing "API too low" warnings while trying to add features. :)

# Compile
I don't know how Android Studio or Gradle work, just click the play button man.

# Install
Either install the usual Android Studio way (adb via USB/Wi-Fi debugging), or create an APK and install it to your phone.

When the app feels less "beta-y", I'll start marking release versions and providing APKs.
